Donate to make Game Pencil Engine greater
=========================================
Work on this engine is not possible without funding. The amount of time it takes to update the codebases, create examples, tutorials and more is quite expensive. Please consider either a one-time or monthly donation to keep this engine going and more frequently updated. 

We have a [Patron Page](https://www.patreon.com/pawbyte?ty=h) that you can help fund future developments of Pencil Engine and to help us kickstart new projects!

There is also a [PayPal](http://www.pawbyte.com/donate/) one time donation method as well. 

I appreciate your generousity and moving this project forward.

Building Game Pencil From Source Code
=====================================
We have made a helpful guide on how to compile Game Pencil from source [here](https://pawbyte.com/building-game-pencil-from-source-code/)

**This editor is coded completely in C/C++ and uses the SDL Library for display, input, output and audio.**

Please note that using the .MP3 format is strongly not recommended due to licensing fees.
